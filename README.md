## Getting Started

Start with your python notebook. The dataset is present on kaggle ( https://www.kaggle.com/c/aw18-19/data ) or contact me.

### Prerequisites


```
-python 3.6

-pip
```

### Work

The prediction is made with a Neural Network on Keras Backend. The steps of the algorithm are: 
- preprocessing data (replace null value with mean or frequency, transformation of categorical features, drop column, standardization
- feature selection (PCA)
- Tuning of parameter with grid search parameter(number of layers,number of neurons,batch size, epochs,dropout,optimizer.
